A hard, procedurally-generated code-breaking puzzle game that you can solve programmatically at higher difficulties and try to make it onto the online leaderboard. Playable for free in the browser, or download to use the API and get the soundtrack included.

The latest experiment is a sci-fi hacker simulation game called [OPERANDi](https://transient-dynamic.itch.io/operandi) (downloadable demo forthcoming!). It is a unique opportunity to learn real scientific skills in a fun and deeply engaging video game. The game involves a variety of intermediate and advanced STEM topics in a practical, realistic, and challenging setting, with a "hard sci-fi" story-driven backdrop. 

I am looking for playtesters and community feedback to help me polish and refine the final product.
