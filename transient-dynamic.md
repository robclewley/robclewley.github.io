My [Transient Dynamic](https://transient-dynamic.itch.io/) creative hobby outlet is the trifecta that combines:

 - My passion for training, mentoring, and professional development
 - My work in data science, software development, and user experience
 - My game development hobby

## Games

### Sum-It

If `A$B = 5`, A and B are digits, and $ is an arithmetic operator, what are their possible solutions? Now what about `AD$AC%DCC%CB = -402`? 

Sum-It is a procedurally-generated code-breaking puzzler that you can solve by hand or programmatically if you want to test out your algorithm and coding skills. Try to make it onto the online leaderboard! It's playable for free in the browser, or download to use the API and get the 4-track OST included.

### Flowee

### OPERANDi

The latest experiment is a sci-fi hacker simulation game called [OPERANDi](https://transient-dynamic.itch.io/operandi) (downloadable demo forthcoming!). It is a unique opportunity to learn real scientific skills in a fun and deeply engaging video game. The game involves a variety of intermediate and advanced STEM topics in a practical, realistic, and challenging setting, with a "hard sci-fi" story-driven backdrop. 

I am looking for playtesters and community feedback to help me polish and refine the final product.
