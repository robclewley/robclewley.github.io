My [Transient Dynamic](https://transient-dynamic.itch.io/) creative hobby outlet is the trifecta that combines:

 - My passion for training, mentoring, and professional development
 - My work in data science, software development, and user experience
 - My game development hobby

The latest experiment is called [OPERANDi](https://transient-dynamic.itch.io/operandi) (downloadable demo expected in Summer '23). It is a unique opportunity to learn both basic and advanced topics involving data and math modeling in a practical, realistic, and challenging simulated setting that's designed to be a fun and deeply engaging video game in its own right.

I am looking for playtesters and community feedback to bring the idea fully to life.
