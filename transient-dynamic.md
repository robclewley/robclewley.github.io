My [Transient Dynamic](https://transient-dynamic.itch.io/) creative hobby outlet is the trifecta that combines:

 - My passion for training, mentoring, and professional development
 - My work in data science, software development, and user experience
 - My game development hobby

The latest experiment is a sci-fi hacker simulation game called [OPERANDi](https://transient-dynamic.itch.io/operandi) (downloadable demo forthcoming!). It is a unique opportunity to learn real scientific skills in a fun and deeply engaging video game. The game involves a variety of intermediate and advanced STEM topics in a practical, realistic, and challenging setting, with a "hard sci-fi" story-driven backdrop. 

I am looking for playtesters and community feedback to help me polish and refine the final product.
