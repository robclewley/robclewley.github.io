My [Transient Dynamic](https://transient-dynamic.itch.io/) creative hobby outlet is the trifecta that combines:

 - My passion for training, mentoring, and professional development
 - My work in data science, software development, and user experience
 - My game development hobby

## Games

### Sum-It

<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/3139741?bg_color=4b147e&amp;fg_color=aaaaaa&amp;link_color=e47c63&amp;border_color=743da7" width="552" height="167"><a href="https://transient-dynamic.itch.io/sum-it">Sum-It by transient-dynamic</a></iframe>

If `A$B = 5`, `A` and `B` are digits, and `$` is an arithmetic operator, what are their possible solutions? Now what about `AD$AC%DCC%CB = -402`? In each move, you can make single position substitutions to see the change in the value on the right hand side, or propose whole solutions.

Sum-It is a procedurally-generated code-breaking puzzler that you can solve by hand or programmatically if you want to test out your algorithm and coding skills. Try to make it onto the online leaderboard! It's playable for free in the browser, or download to use the API and get the 4-track OST included.

The current version of Sum-It running on the web no longer works, and needs a refresh in 2026. The downloadable version is still in good shape.

### Flowee

Flowee is a daily logic puzzle that combines spatial optimization with simple sums. There's a unique easy, medium, and hard puzzle every day. The downloadable version lets you play offline and includes mp3s of the soundtrack and an easy way to share your wins on social media.


### OPERANDi

The latest experiment is a sci-fi hacker simulation game called [OPERANDi](https://transient-dynamic.itch.io/operandi) (downloadable demo forthcoming!). It is a unique opportunity to learn real scientific skills in a fun and deeply engaging video game. The game involves a variety of intermediate and advanced STEM topics in a practical, realistic, and challenging setting, with a "hard sci-fi" story-driven backdrop. 

I am looking for playtesters and community feedback to help me polish and refine the final product.
