I am a British computational neuroscientist living in the US who plays with software until his science gets better.
I want to use this website to document what I do and to help teach people new skills.
An introduction to it can be found in my [first post]({% post_url 2015-03-30-hello-world %}).
For now, a more formal biography can be found at my [GSU page](http://www.ni.gsu.edu/~rclewley/biosketch/index.html). 

Here are my [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/robertclewley) and my [github page](https://github.com/robclewley).
