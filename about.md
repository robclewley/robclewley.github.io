title: About
---

I am a British computational scientist living in the US who plays
with software until my science gets better. I want to use this blog
to document what I do and to help teach people new skills. An
introduction to this blog can be found in my [first post]({% post_url 2015-03-30-hello-world %}).

For now, a more formal biography can be found at my [GSU page](http://www.ni.gsu.edu/~rclewley/biosketch/index.html).

Here is my [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/robertclewley) and my [github page](https://github.com/robclewley).
