# Building the future of computational and data science

Not to sound grandiose, but **Transient Dynamic** is a blog about my
journey towards the future of computational and data science, a
documentation of my new contributions to it, and advocacy about my
approach. Like many academics, I have a lot of opinions and experience
about what's right and wrong in computational science, applied
mathematics, informatics, and scientific publishing, but this blog
will focus on *showing* more than telling, and looking *forward* with
positivity more than backward.

There will be posts that fill in the background to my perspective and
more technical posts that simply show off new tools and capabilities
of my own or of others. (This is also my first blog. I haven't decided
how dry, sarcastic, or *weird* to be yet -- I fear the force of my British roots.)

## Extending CS concepts to apply to regular science

Above all, the **vision** of my current work is to translate several
successful approaches for handling complexity in computer science into
the domain of *regular* science, which sadly lacks the tools to solve
the most exciting problems involving complex physical
systems. IMHO.

Essentially, all reputable, publishable science now being done is
touched upon by some aspect of computational or data science. In turn,
this means that statistics and, increasingly, applied mathematics
areas such as
[dynamical systems modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems_theory),
are important fields that contribute directly to the progress of
scientific research through their ability to formally analyze and
predict patterns in data using *data-driven models*.

At the very least, funding agencies increasingly demand curated, long-term
archiving of research data and papers, and this is supported
technologically by university IT support and various online tools.

Each year, there are more labs that use version control to track,
manage, and backup their data and code. Conference meetings include
more discussions about "reproducible research" and "collaborative
tools for inter-disciplinary science", intros to programming for rusty
old scientists, and so forth.

Despite the buzz[^1] about Big Data, which, from the press, would
appear to be solving all our computational and data problems in
science already, this blog will attempt to convince you that there are
many parts of scientific research and education that are not getting
adequate attention from innovators in information technology. I wish
to contribute something to improve access to advanced modeling
capabilities for academic scientists, students,
[citizen scientists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science), and
engineers.

## The shape of things to come

As a teaser for what lies ahead, my focus right now is on translating
the CS, engineering, and process management concepts known as
["literate programming,"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
["metamodeling,"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamodeling)
["test-driven development,"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
and
["reverse engineering"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering)
over to the domain of mathematical modeling and computational
science.

By this, I mean applying these concepts *not* to the software used for
doing math modeling as such, but to the process of actually *doing*
math modeling itself. That process, admittedly, involves new
software that can benefit from some of these concepts ...[^2]

I will talk less about progress in fancy analytic tools for data, *per
se*, unless it overlaps with something relevant to modeling or my toolset. As you'll
hopefully appreciate, there is a worrying lack of attention to the
role of information technology for math model development compared to
IT for generating and analyzing raw data. This blog intends to help
raise awareness and encourage you to get involved to improve the
future of computational science.
