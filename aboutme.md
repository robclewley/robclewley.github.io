title: About
---

I am a British computational and data scientist living in Atlanta, USA. I want to use this blog to document what I do and to teach people new ways of looking at data and computation. An introduction to this blog can be found in my [first post]({% post_url 2015-03-30-hello-world %}).

For now, a more formal biography can be found at the archive of my [GSU page](https://pydstool.github.io/biosketch/index.html).

Here is my [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/robertclewley) and my [github page](https://github.com/robclewley).
