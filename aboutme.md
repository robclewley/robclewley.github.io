title: About
---

I am a long-time Atlanta-based computational and data scientist, originally from England.

I was an assistant professor at Georgia State University for 7 years before moving into industry as senior data research manager at Mailchimp. I have a CS degree from Cambridge University and a PhD in applied mathematical modeling from Bristol University.

A more detailed academic biography can be found at the archive of my [GSU page](https://pydstool.github.io/biosketch/index.html).

My blog aims to teach people new ways of looking at data and computation. An introduction can be found in my [first post]({% post_url 2015-03-30-hello-world %}).

I also produce [electronic music](https://ripplecountyprimary.bandcamp.com) and engineer for [pumashock](https:/pumashock.bandcamp.com). And I make [techy computer games for hackers](https://transient-dynamic.itch.io) and [for learners](https://aping-pong.herokuapp.com).
